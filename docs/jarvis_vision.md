# Jarvis Vision

Jarvis is intended to become far more than a smart inbox. The goal is to evolve it into an always‑on, privacy‑first agent that acts as your faithful proxy across every information stream and decision surface in your life. The vision rests on five pillars:

## 1. AI Gatekeeper
- Jarvis continuously ingests the feeds that matter (email, chat, voice, device sensors) and surfaces only the items that genuinely need your attention.
- It provides context, recommended options, and next steps, while suppressing noise.

## 2. Autonomous Operator
- Instead of merely notifying, Jarvis acts: schedule payments, file reimbursements, book services, manage brokerage alerts, track health metrics, draft correspondence, and more.
- It either executes tasks automatically (with pre-approved policies) or prepares decisions so that a single confirmation from you completes the action.

## 3. Full-Spectrum Ingestion
- Gmail ingestion today is the starting point; the pipeline will extend to WhatsApp, call transcripts, in-person notes, sensor data, and beyond.
- All signals are normalized into a clean, provenance-rich knowledge base so increasingly capable LLMs can reason over trustworthy data.

## 4. Privacy-First Advocate
- Jarvis answers only to you. It prefers on-device or self-hosted models, redacts sensitive data before external calls, and logs every action for audit.
- In an ecosystem of multi-tenant agents, Jarvis is your loyal emissary—negotiating and collaborating without leaking your information.

## 5. Omnipresent Companion
- Available on web, phone, watch, or a lightweight hardware token, Jarvis is reachable with a quick tap or voice cue.
- It proactively taps you when it detects a high-impact event (critical text, health anomaly, upcoming meeting requiring prep).

## Product Trajectory
1. **Foundation (current work)**  
   - Robust ingestion, chunking, embeddings, FTS indexes.  
   - Hybrid retrieval + thread expansion for grounded answers.  
   - Modular tool registry for running fact builders, semantic search, and context fetchers.

2. **Next steps**  
   - Expand ingestion coverage to additional channels.  
   - Introduce task-centric tools (e.g., payments, scheduling) with sandboxed execution.  
   - Layer in contextual UX surfaces (web dashboard, phone app) that prioritise “what needs me right now.”

3. **Future capability**  
   - Add policy shells governing automation levels, redlines, and escalation rules.  
   - Swap in more powerful LLM planners as they mature while keeping the same clean substrate.  
   - Move towards proactive, cross-channel orchestration in real time.

The long-term vision is Jarvis as your extended mind: loyal, attentive, empowered by clean data, and always acting in your best interest.
