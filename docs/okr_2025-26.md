# Jarvis OKRs — Q4 2025 to Q1 2026

**Mission:** *Turn Jarvis into a dependable, privacy-first personal agent that can identify the tasks which truly need attention and autonomously take the first step toward completing them—grounded in clean data and transparent about every action.*

---

## Objective 1 — Achieve dependable ingestion & retrieval across life streams

| Key Result | Target (by Mar 31, 2026) | Notes |
|------------|--------------------------|-------|
| **KR1**: Integrate ≥3 additional data channels beyond Gmail (e.g., WhatsApp, calls, calendar) with ≥95% ingestion success and provenance tags. | On track | Requires pipeline hardening, provenance metadata. |
| **KR2**: Hybrid retriever answers a curated 200-query benchmark (builder, finance, medical, errands) with ≥90% precision and 0 critical hallucinations. | In progress | Benchmark to be defined; leverage BM25 + embeddings + citations. |

---

## Objective 2 — Enable safe automation for recurring personal tasks

| Key Result | Target (by Mar 31, 2026) | Notes |
|------------|--------------------------|-------|
| **KR3**: Deploy toolbox covering five recurring errands (payments, service calls, reminders) with approval workflows, achieving ≥20 successfully assisted actions. | Planned | Begin with “call/text” scripting tools, track approvals. |
| **KR4**: Implement automation policy shell with at least three levels (observe → suggest → execute) and redline checks, logging 100% of actions for audit. | Planned | Includes privacy guardrails, approval thresholds. |

---

## Objective 3 — Deliver reliable, observable infrastructure

| Key Result | Target (by Mar 31, 2026) | Notes |
|------------|--------------------------|-------|
| **KR5**: Provide containerised worker stack with runbooks and maintain <5% queue failure rate across 30 consecutive days. | Planned | Requires monitoring, retry logic, deployment packaging. |
| **KR6**: Expose configurable alerts/metrics for ingestion lag & automation actions; resolve >90% of alerts within defined SLA. | Planned | Build on new structured logging/config layer. |

### Stretch Targets
- Safe Python execution environment for agent scratchpad computations.
- UI DSL / schema approach for dynamic responses (e.g., trend graphs).
- Prototype ambient listening hardware once policy/privacy layers are established.

These OKRs guide the Q4 2025 roadmap (see `ROADMAP.md`) and will roll forward into Q1 2026 execution.
